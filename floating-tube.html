            <h5 class="card-title">Advertising</h5>
            Advertising partners - ad networks - help us to serve advertisements to you. Some of this technology also helps us to make decisions as to
            whether or not to show a particular advert to you – for example, by informing us that you have shown an interest in similar goods or
            services previously.<br><br>

            Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you use our services or the services of others. This Privacy Policy does
            not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners, and we therefore recommend that you review their privacy
            policies for more information. You can find out more in “How to adjust your preferences” below.<br><br>

            How do ad identifiers and similar technologies work?<br><br>

            Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising (or ad) identifiers to enable and optimise their advertising. Ad identifiers are
            non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple’s ID for advertising, or IDFA. See below
            for you can reset these identifiers or indicate your preference that they should not be used for advertising purposes.<br><br>

            Third parties who advertise on our Services may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in their advertising. These
            technologies operate either by: (i) placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or mobile device; and/or (ii) by
            accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection of data, such as your device’s model, operating system and
            screen size, the other applications installed on your device, and information about how you use our services.<br><br>
